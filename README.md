# 🚀 Brookside BI – Autonomous Sales & Marketing Agents

Welcome to the Brookside BI Agentic System! This repo contains a modular, turn-based framework of specialized AI “expert” agents that power everything from lead capture to contract delivery, all orchestrated under a central Orchestrator agent. Whether you’re adding a new campaign agent or tweaking your CRM integration, you’ll find a clean separation of concerns that makes extending and testing your workflow a breeze.

For a deeper explanation of the architecture—including the event bus, memory service and how AutoGen teams are loaded and how teams start running—see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## ⚡ Quick Start

Install the requirements and run the unit tests to make sure everything is wired correctly:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest -q
```

You can exercise the orchestrator with a single team using a few lines of Python:

```python
from src.solution_orchestrator import SolutionOrchestrator

orch = SolutionOrchestrator({"sales": "src/teams/sales_team_full.json"})
orch.handle_event("sales", {"type": "lead_capture", "payload": {"email": "alice@example.com"}})
```

```

The `tools` package contains submodules for CRM integrations, email and doc generation, ad campaign helpers and more. Each agent has a corresponding unit test under `tests/`. Methods that talk to external services can use the `retry_tool` decorator from `src.utils` to automatically retry transient failures.

### 🏡 Real Estate Expansion

A new `Real Estate Team` demonstrates how the framework can be adapted for other industries. It bundles agents for finding leads, pulling MLS data, creating listings and posting them to major portals. See `src/teams/real_estate_team.json` for the configuration and the accompanying tools under `src/tools/real_estate_tools`.

### 🚚 Operations & Fulfillment Teams

Several additional JSON configs showcase logistics workflows. New teams cover warehouse operations, inventory management, order fulfillment, driver tracking and e-commerce. These rely on the tools in `src/tools/operations_tools` and `src/tools/ecommerce_tool.py` for TMS, inventory and shopping cart integrations along with Microsoft Teams notifications.

### 🚧 Building Modular AutoGen Teams

The JSON files under `src/teams/` showcase how to wire multiple agents together
using [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen). Each file describes a
`RoundRobinGroupChat` with a list of **participants** and optional tools. To
create a new industry workflow:

1. Copy one of the existing team JSONs and update the `participants` section
   with your agents.
2. Add `FunctionTool` entries for any custom business logic your agents need.
3. Adjust the termination conditions (for example `MaxMessageTermination`) to
   control when the team conversation stops.

By editing these declarative configs you can quickly deploy specialised agent
teams for finance, healthcare, manufacturing or any other domain without
changing the core orchestrator code.

A trimmed example from `sales_team_full.json` looks like:

```json
{
  "provider": "autogen_agentchat.teams.RoundRobinGroupChat",
  "config": {
    "participants": [
      {"provider": "src.agents.roles.AssistantAgent", "config": {"name": "orchestrator_agent"}},
      {"provider": "src.agents.roles.AssistantAgent", "config": {"name": "lead_agent"}}
    ],
    "tools": [
      {"provider": "src.tools.crm_tool.CRMTool"}
    ]
  }
}
```

### 🧩 Team & Solution Orchestrators

Teams packaged as JSON in `src/teams/` can now be loaded at runtime using `TeamOrchestrator`. It creates all agents listed under `participants` and provides an `EventBus` for intra-team messaging. Multiple teams are combined with `SolutionOrchestrator` which routes events to the appropriate team and collects their results.

To initialise:
```python
from src.solution_orchestrator import SolutionOrchestrator

orch = SolutionOrchestrator({
    "sales": "src/teams/sales_team_full.json",
    "operations": "src/teams/operations_team.json",
})
orch.handle_event("sales", {"type": "lead_capture", "payload": {}})
```

Teams can report progress upward via `orch.report_status(team, status)`.

Agents may also advertise a list of `skills`. The orchestrator can route a task
to the first agent declaring the requested skill:

```python
orch.delegate_by_skill_sync("copywriting", {"text": "draft this"})
```

#### Planner Agent

For fully automated flows a `PlannerAgent` can be attached to the
`SolutionOrchestrator`. Provide a mapping of goals to task sequences when
constructing the orchestrator:

```python
plans = {
    "demo": [
        {"team": "sales", "event": {"type": "lead_capture", "payload": {"email": "a@example.com"}}},
        {"team": "sales", "event": {"type": "crm_pipeline", "payload": {"deal_id": "d1", "calendar_id": "c", "followup_template": {}}}},
    ]
}
orch = SolutionOrchestrator({"sales": "src/teams/sales_team_full.json"}, planner_plans=plans)
orch.execute_goal("demo")
```

The planner dispatches each event to the appropriate team in order and returns
their combined results.

### 🖥️ Command Line Usage

The project exposes a small CLI for running and interacting with the
`SolutionOrchestrator`.  After installing the package in editable mode you can
start the orchestrator and send events from another shell:

```bash
# launch the orchestrator (listens on localhost:8765)
brookside-cli start sales=src/teams/sales_team_full.json

# dispatch an event
brookside-cli send --team sales --event '{"type": "lead_capture", "payload": {"email": "alice@example.com"}}'

# view latest statuses
brookside-cli status
```

### 🌐 HTTP API

An HTTP interface is available for programmatic access to the
`SolutionOrchestrator`. Start the server with your team mapping and an API key:

```bash
API_AUTH_KEY=mysecret python -m src.api sales=src/teams/sales_team_full.json
```

Send an event using `curl`:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: mysecret" \
     -X POST http://localhost:8000/teams/sales/event \
     -d '{"type": "lead_capture", "payload": {"email": "alice@example.com"}}'
```

Fetch the latest status:

```bash
curl -H "X-API-Key: mysecret" http://localhost:8000/teams/sales/status
```

### 🌟 Creating Custom Teams

To design your own workflow start with one of the JSON files under
`src/teams/` and follow these steps:

1. **Add participants** – list your agent modules under the `participants`
   section. The orchestrator imports these modules dynamically at startup.
2. **Include tools** – provide any helper classes via `FunctionTool` entries so
   agents can call them directly in conversation.
3. **Set termination** – configure AutoGen options like
   `MaxMessageTermination` to decide when the conversation should stop.
4. **Register the file** – pass the JSON path to `SolutionOrchestrator` when
   constructing it. Events sent with the corresponding team name will trigger
   this new chat workflow.

Because teams are purely declarative you can spin up experimental flows without
editing the core Python code.

## 📦 Installation

Install the Python dependencies with pip using the `requirements.txt` file or
install the package in editable mode to make the `brookside-cli` command
available:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

# install the CLI
pip install -e .
```

The optional packages listed in that file (such as `openai` and `google-api-python-client`) are not needed when running the unit tests but enable additional runtime integrations.

### Optional Packages and Features

| Package | Enables |
|---------|---------|
| `openai` | LLM backed agents and chat completions |
| `google-api-python-client` | Google Calendar and other Google service integrations |
| `requests` | HTTP-based memory service |

## 📐 Environment Variables

The system relies on a number of environment variables for API keys and service
endpoints. They are loaded via `src.config.Settings` which reads from the
process environment and a dotenv file.  Set ``ENV`` to choose which file is
loaded (`.env` for ``ENV=prod`` or `.env.<ENV>` otherwise).  You can also set
``ENV_FILE`` to point at an explicit path.  The most common variables are
summarised below. Any of them can be set in your shell or added to the chosen
dotenv file before running the orchestrator or tests.

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Used by agents that call OpenAI models |
| `CRM_API_URL` / `CRM_API_KEY` | Endpoint and key for your CRM integration |
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | Sending transactional email |
| `REDIS_URL` | Backend store for caching and message passing |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Post notifications to Slack channels |
| `TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` | Microsoft Teams notifications |
| `PROMETHEUS_PUSHGATEWAY` | Metrics aggregation endpoint |
| `MLS_API_URL` / `MLS_API_KEY` | Real estate data feed |

For an exhaustive description of all variables see
[docs/environment.md](docs/environment.md).

## 🔬 Testing

The repository contains a suite of unit tests under `tests/`. Execute them with
`pytest`:

```bash
pytest -q
```

## 🐳 Container Usage

Build both the orchestrator and the accompanying memory service using
`docker-compose`:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The compose file starts two services:

* `orchestrator` – launches `brookside-cli start` with the example sales team.
* `memory` – runs a small FastAPI server providing `/store` and `/fetch` APIs.

The orchestrator is automatically configured to talk to the memory service at
`http://memory:8000`.

## 📊 RevOps & Tooling

Recent updates introduce a `RevOpsAgent` that summarizes CRM pipeline KPIs and
publishes revenue forecasts. The orchestrator wires this agent into a global
`EventBus` and triggers it on a monthly cron tick. Several internal utilities are
also included:

* `dev_assist.py` – generate boilerplate modules and matching tests.
* `debugger_agent.py` – listen for `*.Error` events and propose patches.
* `qa_agent.py` – run scripted conversations against `SupportAgent` and emit QA
  reports.
* `review_agent.py` – automatically approve or reject drafts published on the event bus.

These helper scripts keep network calls behind feature flags so they remain
test-safe by default.
