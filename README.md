# 🚀 Brookside BI – Autonomous Sales & Marketing Agents

Welcome to the Brookside BI Agentic System! This repo contains a modular, turn-based framework of specialized AI “expert” agents that power everything from lead capture to contract delivery, all orchestrated under a central Orchestrator agent. Whether you’re adding a new campaign agent or tweaking your CRM integration, you’ll find a clean separation of concerns that makes extending and testing your workflow a breeze.

The `tools` package contains submodules for CRM integrations, email and doc generation, ad campaign helpers and more. Each agent has a corresponding unit test under `tests/`.

### 🏡 Real Estate Expansion

A new `Real Estate Team` demonstrates how the framework can be adapted for other industries. It bundles agents for finding leads, pulling MLS data, creating listings and posting them to major portals. See `src/teams/real_estate_team.json` for the configuration and the accompanying tools under `src/tools/real_estate_tools`.
