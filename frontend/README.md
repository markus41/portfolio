# ReactFlow Workflow Editor

This folder contains a minimal React application powered by [ReactFlow](https://reactflow.dev/).
It provides a drag-and-drop editor for connecting agents and tools into an executable workflow.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The application persists workflows by sending them to the backend via the
`/workflows` API endpoint.
